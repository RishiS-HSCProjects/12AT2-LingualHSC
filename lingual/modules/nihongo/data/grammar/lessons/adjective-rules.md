# Turning Adjectives into Nouns

To turn adjectives into nouns, you can use the following constructions:

:::blockquote い-Adjective (drop the い) + さ :::
:::blockquote な-Adjective (drop the な) + さ :::

This construction expresses the degree or extent of the adjective's quality.

- 高[たか]い (tall) → 高[たか]さ (height)
- 便利[べんり]な (convenient) → 便利[べんり]さ (convenience)
- 速[はや]い (fast) → 速[はや]さ (speed)
- 静[しず]かな (quiet) → 静[しず]かさ (quietness)
- 有名[ゆうめい]な (famous) → 有名[ゆうめい]さ (fame)

This form is often used to describe abstract qualities or characteristics.
