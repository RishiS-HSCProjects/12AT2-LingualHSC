summary: "Learn how to use the 〜と and 〜ら constructions in Japanese to express 'when' and 'if' scenarios."

---

In Japanese, you can express "when" and "if" (conditional) scenarios using the 〜と and 〜ら constructions. These are useful for indicating conditions and time-related events.

と and ら are sometimes interchangeable

- Use ら when second clause is a suggestion, a request, a command, or speaker's choice
- Use と when second clause is an uncontrollable event or state brought about by the first clause

# Using 〜ら
ら is used to express hypothetical situations or conditions, often translated as "if" or "when" in English.

Remember, ら is used when the result is not automatic or inevitable.

:::blockquote Verb (た-Form) + ら + outcome/choice :::

- 宿題[しゅくだい]が終[お]わっ**たら**、遊[あそ]びに行きましょう → When you finish your homework, let's go play.
- 七時**ら**、朝ご飯[はん]を食[た]べます → When it is seven o'clock, I eat breakfast.
- 買わなかった**ら**、うれしがっている。 → If you don't buy it, you will be happy.

:::blockquote Adjective (past-tense) + ら + outcome/choice :::

- 暑[あつ]かっ**たら**、プールに行きます → If it is hot, I will go to the pool.
- 静[しず]か**ら**、としょかんで勉[べん]強[きょう]します → When it is quiet, I study in the library.
- 便利[べんり]じゃなかっ**たら**、使[つか]いません。 → If it is not convenient, I will not use it.

# Using 〜と

と is used to express natural consequences or habitual actions that occur when a certain condition is met. It is often translated as "when" or "if" in English.

Remember, と is used when the result is automatic or inevitable.

:::blockquote Verb (plain present) + と + consequence :::

- 春[はる]になる**と**、花[はな]が咲[さ]きます → When spring comes, flowers bloom.
- ボタンを押[お]す**と**、ドアが開[あ]きます → If you press the button, the door opens.
- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]らない**と**、草[くさ]が育[そだ]ちません → If it doesn't rain, the grass won't grow.
