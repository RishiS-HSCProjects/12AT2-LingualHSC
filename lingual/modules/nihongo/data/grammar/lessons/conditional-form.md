summary: "Learn how to use the 〜と and 〜ら constructions in Japanese to express 'when' and 'if' scenarios."

---

In Japanese, you can express "when" and "if" (conditional) scenarios using the 〜と and 〜ら constructions. These are useful for indicating conditions and time-related events.

と and ら are sometimes interchangeable

- Use ら when second clause is a suggestion, a request, a command, or speaker's choice
- Use と when second clause is an uncontrollable event or state brought about by the first clause

# Using 〜ら
ら is used to express hypothetical situations or conditions, often translated as "if" or "when" in English.

Remember, ら is used when the result is not automatic or inevitable.

:::blockquote Verb (た-Form) + ら + outcome/choice :::

- 宿題[しゅくだい]が終[お]わっ**たら**、遊[あそ]びに行きましょう → When you finish your homework, let's go play.
- 七時**ら**、朝ご飯[はん]を食[た]べます → When it is seven o'clock, I eat breakfast.
- 買わなかった**ら**、うれしがっている。 → If you don't buy it, you will be happy.

:::blockquote Adjective (past-tense) + ら + outcome/choice :::

- 暑[あつ]かっ**たら**、プールに行きます → If it is hot, I will go to the pool.
- 静[しず]か**だったら**、としょかんで勉[べん]強[きょう]します → When it is quiet, I study in the library.
- 便利[べんり]じゃなかっ**たら**、使[つか]いません。 → If it is not convenient, I will not use it.

/t The use of なら in these sentences can change the nuance of it. \

For example, the last sentence could be rephrased using なら as:

:::subject 便[べん]利[り]じゃな<strong>いなら</strong>、使[つか]いません → If it is not convenient, I will not use it. :::

This implies that the choice of not using it is an automatic consequence of the condition of it not being convenient, compared to a person's choice in the original sentence using ら.

## たら vs なら
Both たら and なら can be used to express conditional statements, but they have different nuances and usage contexts:

- **たら - Hypothetical or Future Conditions**: たら is used to express hypothetical situations or conditions that may occur in the future. It is often used when the outcome is uncertain or when the condition is not yet met.
    - For example, if you want to say "If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home," you would say: 明日[あした]雨が降[ふ]ったら、家[いえ]にいます。
    - In this case, たら is used because the condition (rain) is hypothetical and may or may not happen.
    - たら is more like "in this condition, this will happen".

    For example, if you want to say "If I were rich, I would travel the world," you would say: お金持[かねもち]だったら、世界[せかい]を旅[たび]したいです。
    - Here, たら is used to express a hypothetical situation that is not currently true (being rich), and the outcome (traveling the world) is a desire or wish based on that hypothetical condition.
- **なら - General Conditions or Assumptions**: なら is used to express general conditions, assumptions, or when the speaker is making a decision based on a certain condition. It can also be used to give advice or make suggestions.
    - For example, if you want to say "If you are tired, you should rest," you would say: 疲[つか]れたなら、休んだほうがいいですよ。
    - In this case, なら is used because the speaker is making a suggestion based on the condition of being tired, which is a general assumption that can apply to anyone.

With な-adjectives and nouns, use the copula (だったら/じゃなかったら for たら, or なら). For example:
- 静[しず]か**なら**、としょかんで勉[べん]強[きょう]します → If it is quiet, I study in the library.
- 静[しず]か**だったら**、としょかんで勉[べん]強[きょう]します → If it is quiet, I will study in the library.

# Using 〜と

と is used to express natural consequences or habitual actions that occur when a certain condition is met. It is often translated as "when" or "if" in English.

Remember, と is used when the result is automatic or inevitable.

:::blockquote Verb (plain present) + と + consequence :::

- 春[はる]になる**と**、花[はな]が咲[さ]きます → When spring comes, flowers bloom.
- ボタンを押[お]す**と**、ドアが開[あ]きます → If you press the button, the door opens.
- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]らない**と**、草[くさ]が育[そだ]ちません → If it doesn't rain, the grass won't grow.

# Using ～ば

**ば** is a conditional form in Japanese that is used to express "if" or "when" in a more formal or hypothetical context. It is often used to indicate that one action will lead to another action or result.

:::blockquote Godan Verb (drop ます・う) + ば :::

:::blockquote Ichidan Verb (drop ます・る) + れば :::

:::blockquote する → すれば :::
:::blockquote 来[く]る → 来[く]れば :::

:::blockquote い-adjective (drop い) + ければ :::

- 高[たか]い → 高[たか]ければ
- 早[はや]い → 早[はや]ければ

/i This is also where なければなりません also comes from! \

:::blockquote Noun / な-adjective + なら + ば (ば is optional) :::

- 静[しず]か → 静[しず]かならば
- 便利[べんり] → 便利[べんり]ならば
- 学生[がくせい] → 学生なら

/t ば is not always necessary after なら for nouns and な-adjectives. \
