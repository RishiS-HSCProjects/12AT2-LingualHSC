title: "Expressing Obligation"
summary: "Learn how to express obligation in Japanese using various grammatical structures."

---

In Japanese, expressing obligation can be done through several grammatical structures. This lesson will cover the most common ways to indicate that someone has to do something or is obliged to perform an action.

All of the methods discussed in this lesson will be derived from the ない form of the verb. 

:::blockquote Verb in ない form (remove い) + ければ<strong>ならない</strong> :::
:::blockquote Verb in ない form (remove い) + ければ<strong>いけない</strong> :::

Both ならない and いけない can be used interchangeably to express obligation. They both mean "must" or "have to".

For example:

**行かなければ*ならない*** → I have to go.
**行かなければ*いけない*** → I have to go.
In both sentences, the verb 行く (to go) is in its ない form (行かない), and the い is removed before adding ければならない or ければいけない to express obligation.

:::blockquote Verb in ない form + といけません :::
:::blockquote Verb in ない form + とだめです :::

Both といけません and とだめです are also used to express obligation, similar to ならない and いけない. They can be translated as "must" or "have to". However, they carry a slightly softer nuance compared to the previous forms.

For example:
**勉[べん]強[きょう]しないと*いけません*** → I have to study.
**勉[べん]強[きょう]しないと*だめです*** → I have to study.
In both sentences, the verb 勉[べん]強[きょう]する (to study) is in its ない form (勉[べん]強[きょう]しない), and といけません or とだめです is added to express obligation.

These structures are commonly used in everyday conversation and writing to indicate that someone is required to perform a certain action.
