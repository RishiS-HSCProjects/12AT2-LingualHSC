summary: Learn how to use the ～てくれる construction in Japanese to acknowledge favours done for you or others.

---

To say that someone does a favor for you or for someone close to you in Japanese:

:::blockquote Verb (て-form) + くれる (any tense) :::

/w You can not use くれる to talk about favors you have done for others. To express that, you will need to use ～てあげる (which means 'to give') instead. \

For example:

- 友[とも]達[だち]が宿[しゅく]題[だい]を手伝[てつだ]いしてくれました → My friend helped me with my homework.
- 母[はは]が新[あたら]しい本[ほん]を買[か]ってくれた → My mother bought me a new book.
- 聞いてくれてありがとう。 → Thank you for (doing me the favour of) listening.

/t This last phrase is really handy to remember if you ever need to give a speech for an assessment! \
