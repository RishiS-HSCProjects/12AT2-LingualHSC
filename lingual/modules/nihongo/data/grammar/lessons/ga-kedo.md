が and けど are conjunctions in Japanese that are used to connect two clauses, often indicating contrast or a softer tone. They can be translated to "but" or "although" in English, depending on the context. Both conjunctions are commonly used in everyday conversation, but they have slightly different nuances and usage contexts.

## Using が
が is typically used in more formal contexts, such as in written language or polite speech. It is placed between two clauses to indicate a contrast or contradiction.

### Example Sentences with が

- 昨日[きのう]は雨[あめ]**が**、今日は晴[は]れています。→ It was raining yesterday, **but** it is sunny today.

## Using けど
けど is more casual and is often used in spoken language. It can also be used to soften statements, making them sound less direct or harsh.
