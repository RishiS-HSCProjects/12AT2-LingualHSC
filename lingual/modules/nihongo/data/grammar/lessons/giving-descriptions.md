You can say something "looks like" or "seems like" a certain way in Japanese through various structures. This lesson will cover using *そう*, *みたい*, and *よう* for giving descriptions.

# Using そう

そう is used to express that something appears to be a certain way based on visual cues or hearsay. The structure changes depending on whether you're describing appearance or reporting information you've heard.

/i For more ways to use そう to express information, see the [Referencing Information](grammar:referencing-information) lesson. \

## 1. Expressing Appearance

:::blockquote い-adjective (remove い) + そう :::

- このケーキは美[お]味[い]し**そう**です → This cake looks delicious.
- あの映[えい]画[が]は面[おも]白[しろ]**そう**ですね → That movie looks interesting, doesn't it?

:::blockquote な-adjective + そう :::
- 彼[かれ]は親[しん]切[せつ]**そう**な人[ひと]です → He seems like a kind person.
- 今日[きょう]の天気[てんき]は良[よ]さ**そう**です → Today's weather looks good.

:::blockquote Verb stem + そう :::
- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]り**そう**です → It looks like it's going to rain.
- 彼[かれ]は今[いま]にも来[き]**そう**です → He looks like he's about to come any moment now.

## 2. Expressing Hearsay

:::blockquote い-adjective (keep い) + そう :::

- このレストランは高[たか]い**そう**です → I heard that this restaurant is expensive.
- あの話[はなし]は面[おも]白[しろ]い**そう**です → I heard that the story is interesting.

:::blockquote な-adjective + だ + そう :::

- 庭[にわ]は静[しず]かできれい**だそう**です → I heard that the garden is quiet and beautiful.

/w Students often forget to include the だ before そう when using な-adjectives in hearsay. Remember to include it! \

:::blockquote Verb (dictionary form) + そう :::

- 先[せん]生[せい]は毎[まい]日[にち]ジョギングをする**そう**です → I heard that he jogs every day.

# Using みたい

よう is a more formal way to express that something seems like or looks like a certain way. It is often used in written Japanese.
