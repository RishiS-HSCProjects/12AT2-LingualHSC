In Japanese, the particles から and ので are commonly used to express reasons or causes for actions or situations. Both particles can be translated to "because" or "since" in English, but they have slightly different nuances and usage contexts.

# Using から to Give Reasons
から is often used in casual or informal contexts to indicate the reason for an action or situation. It is placed after the reason clause and before the result clause.

/i While から traditionally is used in more casual settings (compared to ので), you can use both interchangeably in your HSC examinations without penalty. \

:::blockquote Verb/Adjective + から :::

/w Note that when using から with な-adjectives and nouns, you need to add だ before から. \

For example:

- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]っている**から**、出かけません。→ Because it is raining, I will not go out.
- 疲[つか]れた**から**、早[はや]く寝[ね]ます。→ Because I am tired, I will go to bed early.
- 学生**だから**、チケットはもっと安[やす]かったです。→ Because I am a student, the tickets were cheaper.

# Using ので to Give Reasons
ので is considered more polite and formal than から. It is often used in written language or polite speech. Like から, it is placed after the reason clause and before the result clause.

:::blockquote Verb/Adjective + ので :::

/w Similar to から, when using ので with な-adjectives and nouns, you need to add だ before ので. \

For example:

- 十七才だ**ので**、さけを飲[の]んではいけません。→ Because I am seventeen, I cannot drink alcohol.
- 風[かぜ]が強[つよ]い**ので**、窓[まど]を閉[し]めてください。→ Because the wind is strong, please close the window.
- 宿題[しゅくだい]が多[おお]い**ので**、今日は遊[あそ]べません。→ Because I have a lot of homework, I cannot play today.
