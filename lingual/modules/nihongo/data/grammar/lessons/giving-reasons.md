title: "Giving Reasons"
summary: "Learn how to use the particles から, ので and し to give reasons in Japanese sentences."

---

In Japanese, the particles から and ので are commonly used to express reasons or causes for actions or situations. Both particles can be translated to "because" or "since" in English, but they have slightly different nuances and usage contexts.

# Using から to Give Reasons
から is often used in casual or informal contexts to indicate the reason for an action or situation. It is placed after the reason clause and before the result clause.

/i While から traditionally is used in more casual settings (compared to ので), you can use both interchangeably in your HSC examinations without penalty. \

:::blockquote Verb/Adjective + から :::

/w Note that when using から with な-adjectives and nouns, you need to add だ before から. \

For example:

- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]っている**から**、出かけません。→ Because it is raining, I will not go out.
- 疲[つか]れた**から**、早[はや]く寝[ね]ます。→ Because I am tired, I will go to bed early.
- 学生**だから**、チケットはもっと安[やす]かったです。→ Because I am a student, the tickets were cheaper.

# Using ので to Give Reasons
**ので** is considered more polite and formal than **から**. It is often used in written language or polite speech. Like **から**, **ので** is placed after the reason clause and before the result clause.

**ので** also carries a nuance of being softer and more apologetic than **から**, which makes it ideal when offering reasons or excuses in polite speech.

:::blockquote Verb/い-Adjective + ので :::

/w *Similar to **から**, when using **ので** with **nouns** and **な-adjectives**, **だ** is generally required in **formal speech**. In **casual speech**, **だ** is often dropped, especially with **な-adjectives** (like ひま), but it is typically retained with **identity nouns** (like 学生). \

:::blockquote Noun + だ + ので :::  
:::blockquote な-Adjective + だ + ので (formal/polite) :::  
:::blockquote な-Adjective + な + ので (casual) :::

For example:

- 十七才**だので**、さけを飲[の]んではいけません → Because I am seventeen, I cannot drink alcohol.  
    - Here, **だ** is used because age is an **identity noun**.
- 彼女は親切**なので**、みんなに好かれています → Because she is kind, everyone likes her.  
    - Here, **だ** is dropped because **親切** is a **な-adjective**.
    - **だ** woudln't be dropped in formal speech: **親切だので**.
- 風が強い**ので**、窓を閉めてください → Because the wind is strong, please close the window.
- 宿題が多い**ので**、今日は遊べません → Because I have a lot of homework, I cannot play today.

# Using し to List Multiple Reasons
In addition to から and ので, the particle し can be used to list multiple reasons for an action or situation. It is often used in casual speech and can convey a sense of "not only... but also..."

:::blockquote Verb (any form)/い-Adjective + し :::
:::blockquote な-Adjective/Noun + だ + し :::

For example:

- ルビーさんはやさしいし、おもしろいし、さいこうの友達です → Ruby is kind, interesting, and the best friend ever.
- このレストランは安いし、おいしいし、サービスもいいし、よく来ます。→ Since this restaurant is cheap, delicious, and has good service, I come here often.
- 彼[かれ]は頭[あたま]がいいし、スポーツもできるし、人気者[にんきもの]です。→ He is smart, good at sports, and popular.

/i There is no limit to how many reasons you can list using し. You can continue adding as many reasons as needed to convey your message effectively. However, be mindful to be succinct enough that you do not overwhelm your listener or reader. \
