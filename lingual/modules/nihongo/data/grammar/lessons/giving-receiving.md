# Favours

:::blockquote Giver + は・が + receiver + に + Verb (て-form) + [To Give・To Receive] :::

## Doing a favour for someone else

/i ～てさしあげます is used when the receiver is senior to the person giving \
/i ～てやります is used when the receiver is an animal, plant, or someone younger. \

/w Using てあげます can sound boastful and therefore should be avoided. \

In Japanese, it is not appropriate to emphasise the fact that you are doing a favour for someone. If you want to talk about something you did for someone else, simply use the verb is standard form.

For example, using 料[りょう]理[り]しました rather than 料[りょう]理[り]してあげました.

- しんごくんはまいちゃんにきれいな花[はな]をかってあげました → Shigo bought a pretty flower for Mai.
- しんごくんは花に水[みず]をやりました → Shigo watered the flower.

## Receiving a favour from someone.

/i ～てくれました is for general usage. \
/i ～てくださいます is for when the person is more senior to you. \

- 先[せん]生[せい]は私[わたし]たちにすじを作[つく]ってくださいました → The teacher made sushi for us (respectful).
- けんくんのお父[とう]さんはぼくにしゃしんを送[おく]ってくださいました。→ Ken's father sent me a photo (respectful).


To say that someone does a favor for you or for someone close to you in Japanese:

:::blockquote Verb (て-form) + くれる (any tense) :::

/w You can not use くれる to talk about favors you have done for others. To express that, you will need to use ～てあげる (which means 'to give') instead. \

For example:

- 友[とも]達[だち]が宿[しゅく]題[だい]を手伝[てつだ]いしてくれました → My friend helped me with my homework.
- 母[はは]が新[あたら]しい本[ほん]を買[か]ってくれた → My mother bought me a new book.
- 聞いてくれてありがとう。 → Thank you for (doing me the favour of) listening.

/t This last phrase is really handy to remember if you ever need to give a speech for an assessment! \
