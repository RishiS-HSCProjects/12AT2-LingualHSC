title: "Particle は vs が"
summary: "Learn about the differences between the particles は and が in Japanese and how to use them correctly."

---

In Japanese, the particles は (wa) and が (ga) are both used to mark subjects in sentences, but they serve different functions and convey different nuances. A lot of times, learners of Japanese find it challenging to understand when to use は and when to use が, since their interchangable usage can be quite subtle and context-dependent. This lesson aims to clarify the differences between these two particles and provide guidance on their correct usage.

/w Please note that much of the content covered in this lesson was adapted from <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/">Tofugu's "は and が" article</a>. This article goes through some of the linguistic challenges in learning the difference between は and が. However, we will only focus on the main differences here. For further reading, we highly encourage you to visit their website. \

# The Particle が
The particle が is primarily used to mark the **subject** of a sentence. In other words, the person or thing before the が is the one performing the action or being described. Linguistically speaking, they are the **subject**. が is often used when introducing new information or when the subject is not known to the listener.

However, the nuance of が is that it places emphasis on a specific subject, rather than a general one.

For example: **先生が来[き]ています。** → The teacher is coming.

Here, が implies that we are talking about a specific teacher, perhaps in contrast to other teachers who are not coming. I.e. we aren't saying that any random teacher is coming, but rather that a specific one is.

Another example: **これが中山先生の家[いえ]です。** → This is Professor Nakayama's house.

In this case, が is used to emphasise that "this" (pointing to a specific house) is the one that belongs to Professor Nakayama, rather than any other house.

You will commonly come across が in sentences that describe existence, such as those using the verbs ある (to exist for inanimate objects) and いる (to exist for animate objects). For example: **猫[ねこ]がいます。** → There is a cat.

This is because we are introducing the existence of a cat, which is new information to the listener, and we are emphasising that this specific being is a cat, rather than all the other animals that may exist.

:::blockquote TL;DR: が emphasizes a specific subject or new information to a listener. :::

# The Particle は
On the other hand, the particle は is not picking out a specific subject, but rather marking the **topic** of the sentence, paragraph, or conversation. The topic is what the sentence is about, and it may not necessarily be the subject performing the action. It can be directly translated to "as for [topic]".

That is the difference between talking about a specific cat (using が) versus talking about cats in general (using は).

In a sense, は tells the listener what we are generally talking about now. For example: **今日は暑[あつ]かったです。晴[は]れでした。それから、外[そと]に行かなかった。** → Today was hot. And, it was sunny. For that reason, I didn't go outside.

/i Keep in mind that は is used for topics the listener already knows about. This can be seen above as the listener already knows that "today" exists! \

Here, は is used to indicate that the **topic** of interest is "today". This allowed us to make further statements about today, such as it being hot and sunny, without needing to repeat "today" in each sentence. If I were to continue that paragraph, however, I can switch the topic to something else using another は. For example: ***今日は暑[あつ]かったです。晴[は]れでした。それから、外[そと]に行かなかった。*::red{でも、明日[あした]は雨[あめ]が降[ふ]るそうです。}** → Today was hot. And, it was sunny. For that reason, I didn't go outside. However, tomorrow, it seems that it will rain.

Notice how I switched the topic from "today" to "tomorrow" using another は. If I were to add another sentence about tomorrow, I wouldn't need to add another subject marker to the next sentence, since は already marked "tomorrow" as the topic of interest.

:::blockquote TL;DR: は marks the topic of the sentence, which is what the sentence is generally about. :::

# The Difference Between は and が
Let me bring back a previous paragraph to illustrate the difference between は and が
:::blockquote 今日は暑[あつ]かったです。晴[は]れでした。それから、外[そと]に行かなかった。でも、明日[あした]は雨[あめ]が降[ふ]るそうです。:::

In this paragraph, we can see both は and が being used.

- The first は marks "today" as the topic of interest, allowing us to make further statements about today without needing to repeat "today" in each sentence.
- The second は marks "tomorrow" as the new topic of interest. This has the same effect as the first は, allowing us to make further statements about tomorrow without needing to repeat "tomorrow" in each sentence.
- The が marks "rain" as the specific subject that will be falling tomorrow. This is new information to the listener, and we are emphasising that it is rain that will be falling, rather than any other weather condition. However, we are not telling the listener that "rain" is the new topic of interest and all further statements will be about rain, since we are using が.

/i Another way to think about it is that, in a sentence, は is the main topic, while が is a specific subject in that matter. \

## Emphasis
Tofugu's article goes into depth about this section really nicely.

は gives the nuance that the topic is being discussed is something the listener already knows about, and it shouldn't be something that the listener should need to pay special attention to. It is just so that they know the *general* focus of the sentence.

が gives the nuance that the information being discussed is something that is new or can not be inferred from context, and it is something that the listener should pay special attention to. が can highlight that the information is important or relevant to the conversation, and may not have entered the listener's mind yet.

---

All of that explanation is, admittedly, quite vague. So, I'm going to quote a fantastic example from Tofugu's article that really helped me understand the difference between は and が.

Let's take a look at the following sentence:

1. 月**は**きれいだ。 (The moon is beautiful.)

This sentence uses は to mark 月 (the moon) as the topic of interest. The speaker is making a general statement about the moon, which is something the listener (hopefully) already knows about. The focus is on the beauty of the moon in general.

However, if we leave out the topic and just say:

2. 月**が**きれいだ。 (The moon is beautiful.)

a whole new nuance is introduced. In a very English-literature sense, we are highlighting the moon as a protagonist and drawing special attention to it. We are implying that the beauty of the moon is something surprising or noteworthy in the current context, and we are taken aback by it.

If we were to put this into a scenario, imagine you are outside on a clear night with a friend. You both look up at the sky and see the moon shining brightly. You might say:
- 今夜は月**が**きれいだね。 (The moon is beautiful tonight, isn't it?)

Here, we are saying the topic of the conversation is "tonight", but we are emphasising that the moon is particularly beautiful tonight, which may be profounding to us in this moment. 

The choice of particle changes the nuance of the sentence significantly, even though the literal translation remains the same. Native speakers usually don't need to think about these differences consciously, but for learners of Japanese, understanding the distinction between は and が can be crucial for understanding and conveying the intended meaning in conversations.

Another example from Tofugu's article is:
- あなたはジェニーですか。 (Are you Jenny?)
- あなたがジェニーですか。 (Are you Jenny?)

The first sentence can be broadly translated as "As per your attributes specifically, are you Jenny?"

The second sentence can be broadly translated as "Out of all the people here, are you Jenny?"

## Multiple Topics
In some cases, a sentence may contain multiple topics, each marked by は. In such cases, the first は typically marks the primary topic, while subsequent は particles mark secondary topics. The nuance here is that the primary topic is the main focus of the sentence, while the secondary topics provide additional context or information related to the primary topic.

For example:
つめたい食べ物**は**好きじゃないだけど、すし**は**大好き! → Although I don't like cold food, I love sushi!

Here, the first は marks "cold food" as the primary topic, indicating that the speaker is discussing their general preference for cold food. The second は marks "sushi" as a secondary topic, highlighting that despite their general dislike for cold food, they have a specific fondness for sushi.

Thus, the topic of my future argument changes to "sushi". If I were to continue that sentence, I wouldn't need to add another subject marker to the next sentence, since は already marked "sushi" as the topic of interest.

For example:
*つめたい食べ物**は**好きじゃないだけど、すし**は**大好き!* 毎[まい]週[しゅう]末[まつ]に食[た]べに行[い]く。 → Although I don't like cold food, I love sushi! I go to eat it [sushi] every weekend.

This can be a strange concept to wrap your head around, especially since English does not have particles like は and が (we have our own confusing articles like "a" and "the" instead!). However, with practice and exposure to Japanese, you will start to develop an intuition for when to use は and when to use が naturally.

Again, we strongly recommend reading the full article on Tofugu for a deeper understanding of this topic: <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/">Tofugu's "は and が" article</a>.
