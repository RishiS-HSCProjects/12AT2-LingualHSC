title: "Expressing Intentions and Plans"
summary: "Learn how to express intentions and plans in Japanese."

--- 

In this lesson, you will learn two grammatical structures used to express intentions and plans in Japanese: ～つもりです and ～予[よ]定[てい]です (respectively).

The reason these two structures are taught together is that they are often confused by learners due to their similar meanings. This lesson will clarify the differences between them and provide examples of how to use each one correctly.

# Intentions: ～つもりです

When you **intend** to do something, you have a **desire** to perform an action in the future. In Japanese, you can express this intention using the structure:

:::blockquote Verb (plain present) + つもりです :::

- 来[らい]年[ねん]日本に行く**つもりです** → I intend to go to Japan next year.
- 来[らい]月[げつ]新[あたら]しい車[くるま]を買[か]う**つもりです** → I intend to buy a new car next month.
- 来[らい]週[しゅう]から毎[まい]日[にち]運[うん]動[どう]する**つもりです** → I intend to exercise every day from next week.

# Plans: ～予[よ]定[てい]です

When you have **plans** to do something, it means you have already **arranged or scheduled** an action to take place in the future. In Japanese, you can express this plan using the structure:

:::blockquote Verb (plain present) + 予[よ]定[てい]です :::

- 来[らい]年[ねん]日本に行く**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to go to Japan next year.
- 来[らい]月[げつ]新[あたら]しい車[くるま]を買[か]う**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to buy a new car next month.
- 来[らい]週[しゅう]から毎[まい]日[にち]運[うん]動[どう]する**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to exercise every day from next week.

/t You may have also seen or heard <em>よていがある</em> in Japanaese content, which means "To have plans". \

# Differences Between ～つもりです and ～予[よ]定[てい]です

The key difference between these two structures lies in the level of commitment and arrangement involved:

- ～つもりです (intention) indicates a personal desire or intention to do something, but it may not be firmly decided or arranged yet.
- ～予[よ]定[てい]です (plan) indicates that you have already made arrangements or scheduled the action, showing a higher level of commitment.

For example

- 来[らい]年[ねん]日本に行く**つもりです** → I intend to go to Japan next year.
    - This suggests that you want to go to Japan, but you may not have made any concrete plans yet.
- 来[らい]年[ねん]日本に行く**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to go to Japan next year.
    - This indicates that you have already made arrangements to go to Japan next year.
    - You might have already booked your flight or accommodation.

Another example:

- 来[らい]月[げつ]新[あたら]しい車[くるま]を買[か]う**つもりです** → I intend to buy a new car next month.
    - This suggests that you want to buy a new car, but you may not have decided on the model or made any arrangements yet.

- 来[らい]月[げつ]新[あたら]しい車[くるま]を買[か]う**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to buy a new car next month.
    - This indicates that you have already made arrangements to buy a new car next month.
    - You might have already chosen the model and scheduled a visit to the dealership.
    - You may also be waiting for the car to be shipped!


Last example:

- 来[らい]週[しゅう]から毎[まい]日[にち]運[うん]動[どう]する**つもりです** → I intend to exercise every day from next week.
    - This suggests that you want to start exercising every day, but you may not have a specific routine or schedule yet.
    - This could be a new year's resolution that may be broken come February!
- 来[らい]週[しゅう]から毎[まい]日[にち]運[うん]動[どう]する**予[よ]定[てい]です** → I have plans to exercise every day from next week.
    - This indicates that you have already made arrangements to exercise every day from next week.
    - You might have already created a workout schedule or joined a gym with a commitment plan.
    - You may have even informed your friends or family about your plans to hold yourself accountable!

# Declining invitations due to other plans

When you want to decline an invitation because you have other plans, you can use the ～予[よ]定[てい]です structure to politely explain your situation.

:::blockquote Prior commitment (Verb in plain form) + 予[よ]定[てい]なんです :::

- すみません、明日[あした]は友[とも]達[だち]のけっこんしきに行く**予[よ]定[てい]なんです** → Sorry, I have plans to go to my friend's wedding tomorrow.
- 申し訳[もうしわけ]ないですが、来[らい]週[しゅう]は仕事[しごと]の出張[しゅっちょう]**予[よ]定[てい]なんです** → I'm sorry, but I have a business trip planned for next week.
/t もうしわけ is a polite way to say "sorry" or "apologies" in Japanese. \

:::blockquote Prior commitment (noun) + の + 予[よ]定[てい]なんです :::

- ごめんなさい、明日[あした]は家族[かぞく]の集[あつ]まり**の予[よ]定[てい]なんです** → Sorry, I have a family gathering planned for tomorrow.
- すみません、今[こん]週[しゅう]は学校[がっこう]の試[し]験[けん]**の予[よ]定[てい]なんです** → I'm sorry, but I have school exams planned for next week.

/i The use of なん after 予[よ]定[てい] is a casual way to soften the statement and make it sound more natural in conversation. \
