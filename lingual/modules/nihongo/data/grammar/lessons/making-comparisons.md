There are several ways to make comparisons in Japanese. This lesson will cover some of the most common methods found in the HSC syllabus.

# どちら ・ より
The word **どちら** (dochira) is used to ask "which one" when comparing two items. It can be used in questions like:

- **どちら**が好きですか？ "Which one do you like?"
- **どちら**の本が面[おも]白[しろ]いですか？ "Which book is interesting?"

To compare two items, you can use the structure:

:::blockquote [Noun A] と [Noun B] と + **どちら**のほうが + adjective :::

Breaking this structure down:

- と: This particle is used to connect two nouns, similar to "and" in English.
- **どちら**: This means "which one" when comparing two items.
- のほうが: This phrase indicates the direction of comparison, similar to "is more" in English.
- adjective: This is the adjective used to describe the items being compared.

This structure translates to "Between [Noun A] and [Noun B], which one is more [adjective]?"

For example:
- 猫[ねこ]と犬[いぬ]と**どちら**のほうが好きですか？ "Between cats and dogs, which one do you like more?"
- 夏[なつ]と冬[ふゆ]と**どちら**のほうがいいですか？ "Between summer and winter, which one is better?"

To respond to such questions, you can use the structure:
:::blockquote [Noun A] のほうが [Noun B] より + [adjective] + です :::
*or*
:::blockquote [Noun A] は [Noun B] より + [adjective] + です :::

/t It's important to understand the placement of the より! \

The above structures translate to "[Noun B] is more [adjective] than [Noun A]."

The adjective is applied to the noun that comes after のほうが or は.

# ほど

The particle **ほど** is used to express "to the extent of" or "as much as" when making comparisons.

It is used in negative sentences to indicate that something is **not** as [adjective] as something else.

:::blockquote [Noun A] は [Noun B] ほど + [adjective (negative)] :::

The adjective is applied to the noun that comes after のほうが or は.

/w For ほど, the adjective must always be in the negative form. \

For example:

- 夏[なつ]は冬[ふゆ]ほどさむくないです → Summer is not as cold as winter.
- 日本の食べ物[もの]は韓[かん]国[こく]ほど辛[から]くないです → Japanese food is not as spicy as Korean food.

# Opposition は - が - は Pattern
/w This grammar structure is not explicitly covered in the HSC syllabus, but it is useful for making comparisons. \

Another way to make comparisons is by using the **は - が - は** pattern. This structure is used to highlight the opposing differences between two subjects.

:::blockquote  [Noun A] は [adjective A] が、[Noun B] は [adjective B] :::

This structure can be translated to "[Noun A] is [adjective A], **but** [Noun B] is [adjective B]."

For example:

- 日本語は発[はつ]音[おん]はやさしいが、文[ぶん]保[ほ]はむずかしいです → Japanese pronunciation is easy, **but** grammar is difficult.
- ぞうは鼻[はな]は長[なが]いが、しっぽは短[みじか]いです → Elephants have a long nose (trunk), **but** a short tail.

# Supporting も - し - も Pattern
/w This grammar structure is not explicitly covered in the HSC syllabus, but it is useful for making comparisons. \

The **も - し - も** pattern is exactly the opposite of the **は - が - は** pattern. It is used to highlight the similarities between two subjects.

:::blockquote [Noun A] も [adjective A] し、[Noun B] も [adjective B] :::

This structure can be translated to "Not only is [Noun A] [adjective A], **but also** [Noun B] is [adjective B]."

For example:

- 私はおなかもすいたし、のどもかわきました → I am hungry, **and** thirsty too.
- あの店[みせ]はねだんもたかいし、品[しな]ぞろえもいいです → That store has expensive prices, **and** a good selection too.
