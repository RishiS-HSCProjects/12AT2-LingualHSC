In Japanese, there are several particles that can be used to express the concept of "only." The choice of particle depends on the context and the type of word it is attached to. 


# Using しか
しか is used in negative sentences to mean "only" or "nothing but." It emphasizes the limitation of the subject.

:::blockquote [Noun/Verb/Adjective] + しか + [Negative Verb] :::

- 私[わたし]は水[みず]**しか**飲[の]みません。→ I drink nothing but water.
- 彼[かれ]は日本語**しか**話[はな]せない。→ He can speak nothing but Japanese.
- 昨日[きのう]は百円**しか**使[つか]わなかった。→ I spent nothing but 100 yen yesterday.

/t While it may sound weird to translate these sentences as "I only drink nothing but water," getting in the habit of calling しか as "nothing but X" instead of "only X" will help you understand its difference with だけ. \

# Using だけ
だけ is used in affirmative sentences to mean "only" or "just." It indicates that something is limited to a certain extent.

:::blockquote [Noun/Verb/Adjective (with な if applicable)] + だけ :::

だけ comes after the word it modifies. For example, if you want to "this shop only sells fans", you would put the だけ after 扇[せん]子[す], meaning "fans".

- この店[みせ]は扇[せん]子[す]**だけ**売[う]っています → This shop only sells fans.
- 三時間**だけ**勉[べん]強[きょう]しました → She studied for only three hours.
- りんごだけ食べる → I only eat apples.

# Differences between しか and だけ

しか emphasises the speaker’s feeling of the situation as something unique or exclusive, with an inclination towards something.

だけ used to describe a situation that does not involve a personal feeling from the speaker. There is no judgement and the intended meaning from the speaker is neutral.

- ケーキ**だけ**食べました → I only ate cake. (neutral statement of fact)
- ケーキ**しか**食べませんでした → I ate nothing but cake. (implies that the speaker is dissatisfied with only eating cake)
