summary: "Learn about the Japanese particle へ, which indicates direction or destination in a sentence."

---

The particle へ (pronounced "e", not "he") is used in Japanese to indicate direction or destination. It is similar to the English prepositions "to" or "towards".

## Highlighting Direction
The particle へ specifically highlights the **direction** of movement rather than the action or the destination itself. This means that when you use へ, you are focusing on where a subject is headed, and not necessarily whether they will arrive there.

:::blockquote ::blue{[Destination]} へ ::red{[Action]} :::
/w The Term <i>::blue{Destination}</i> can be rather misleading, as へ does not emphasise the destination itself, but rather the direction towards it. This is the nuance between going somewhere (に) and heading there (へ). \

### Examples of Highlighting Direction
- ::blue{空[そら]}へ ::red{飛[と]びます} → I will ::red{fly} towards the ::blue{sky}.
- ねこは::blue{彼[かの]女[じょ]}へ ::red{見ています} → ||The cat is ::red{looking} towards ::blue{her}||.
- 子[こ]供[ども]たちは::blue{遊[あそ]び場[ば]}へ ::red{走[はし]っています} → ||The children are ::red{running} towards the ::blue{playground}||.
- 彼女[かのじょ]は::blue{先生[せんせい]}へ ::red{質問[しつもん]をしています} → ||She is ::red{asking} a question to the ::blue{teacher}||.

## Intent-to-Go Structure

When using へ, it is important to note that it emphasises the **direction of movement** rather than the action itself. This means that while へ indicates where someone is going, it does not specify what they will do there.

That is what the particle に is for!

The following structure uses へ and に together to describe the **intent** of going somewhere.

:::blockquote ::blue{[Destination]} へ ::green{[Purpose]} に ::red{[Action]} :::

/t The ::blue{[Destination]} へ and ::green{[Purpose]} に can be swapped around depending on what you want to emphasize. \

### How the Structure Works
- The noun before へ is the ::blue{[Destination]} (where the subject is going).
- The noun before に is the ::green{[Purpose]} (the reason for going).  
  Often this is the **root form of a verb**, which functions as a noun.
- The final verb is the ::red{[Action]} performed at the destination.  
  Common verbs include 行く, 来[く]る, and 帰[かえ]る, though other movement verbs can appear.

### Examples of Describe Intent Structure
- ::blue{学校}へ ::green{勉[べん]強[きょう]}に ::red{行きます} → I am ::red{going} to ::blue{school} to ::green{study}.
- ::green{買い物[もの]}に ::blue{スーパー}へ ::red{行きます} → To do some ::green{shopping}, I am ::red{going} to the ::blue{supermarket}.
- ::blue{友達[だち]}へ ::green{遊[あそ]び}に ::red{行きます} → ||I am ::red{going} to my ::blue{friend} to ::green{hang out}.||
- ::blue{図[と]書[しょう]館[かん]}へ ::green{本をかり}に ::red{行きます} → ||I am ::red{going} to the ::blue{library} to ::green{borrow books}.||
- 犬[いぬ]と::green{さんぽ}に ::blue{家[いえ]}へ もっと早[はや]く ::red{帰[かえ]ります} → ||I will ::red{return} ::blue{home} earlier to ::green{walk with my dog}.||
