summary: "Learn about the plain form (dictionary form) of Japanese verbs."

---

In Japanese, the plain form (also known as the dictionary form) of verbs is the most basic form of the verb. It is called the dictionary form because it is the form you will find in dictionaries. The plain form is used in casual speech, informal writing, and when making statements or asking questions in a straightforward manner.

/t Dictionaries are permitted in the HSC Examination. Being able to quickly manipulate verbs in the dictionary form is a valuable skill in preparation of your exam. \

Japanese verbs are categorised into [three main groups](grammar:verb-groups) based on their conjugation patterns. Each group has its own set of rules for forming the plain form.

## Present Positive Plain Form
To conjugate a verb into the present positive plain form, remove the ます and...

- For Group 1 verbs, change the final い sound to its corresponding う (u) sound.

    - 話します → 話す (to speak)
    - 書[か]きます → 書[か]く (to write)
    - 飲[の]みます → 飲[の]む (to drink)

- For Group 2 verbs, simply add る.

    - 食べます → 食べる (to eat)
    - 見ます → 見る (to see)

- For Group 3 verbs, use the irregular forms.

    - します → する (to do)
    - 来[く]ます → 来[く]る (to come)
    - 行きます → 行く (to go)

/i Verbs created from adding します to nouns use する in their plain form. If you are confused, try the below quiz! \

## Present Negative Plain Form
To conjugate a verb into the present negative plain form, follow these rules:

- For Group 1 verbs, change the final う (u) sound to its corresponding あ (a) sound and add ない.

    - 話します → 話さ**ない** (not to speak)
    - 書[か]きます → 書[か]か**ない** (not to write)
    - 飲[の]みます → 飲[の]ま**ない** (not to drink)

- For Group 2 verbs, remove ます and add ない.
    - 食べます → 食べ**ない** (not to eat)
    - 見ます → 見**ない** (not to see)

- For Group 3 verbs, use the irregular forms.
    - します → し**ない** (not to do)
    - 来[く]ます → 来[こ]**ない** (not to come)
    - 行きます → 行か**ない** (not to go)

/w Note that くる (to come) becomes こない in its negative plain form. The Kanji 来 is used for both. \

## Past Positive Plain Form
To conjugate a verb into the past positive plain form, follow these rules:

- For Group 1 verbs, convert the verb to its た-form. Note that the た-form is just the て-form with て replaced by た and で replaced by だ. Learn more about the て-form [here](grammar:te-form).

    - 話します → 話した (spoke)
    - 書[か]きます → 書[か]いた (wrote)
    - 飲[の]みます → 飲[の]んだ (drank)

- For Group 2 verbs, remove ます and add た.
    - 食べます → 食べた (ate)
    - 見ます → 見た (saw)

    - します → した (did)
    - 来[き]ます → 来[き]た (came)
    - 行きます → 行った (went)

## Past Negative Plain Form
To conjugate a verb into the past negative plain form, change the verb to its present negative plain form and replace ない with なかった. This is similar to how you would form the past negative of adjectives.

- For Group 1 verbs:
    - 話します → 話さ**なかった** (did not speak)
    - 書[か]きます → 書[か]か**なかった** (did not write)
    - 飲[の]みます → 飲[の]ま**なかった** (did not drink)

- For Group 2 verbs:
    - 食べます → 食べ**なかった** (did not eat)
    - 見ます → 見**なかった** (did not see)

- For Group 3 verbs:
    - します → し**なかった** (did not do)
    - 来[き]ます → 来[こ]**なかった** (did not come)
    - 行きます → 行か**なかった** (did not go)

    /w Recall the present negative of 来[き]ます is pronounced こない. \
