title: "Referencing Information"
summary: "Learn how to source and reference information."

---

**によると** means "according to" and is used to reference information obtained from a specific source, such as a person, book, or article.

/i This structure is usually used when referencing information when writing formal texts like reports and articles. You wouldn't use it in casual conversation. \

:::blockquote Source + によると + <em>Information</em> + そう・らしい :::

# そう vs らしい
Both そう and らしい can be used after によると to indicate that the information is hearsay or reported speech. However, there are slight differences in their usage:

**そう - Direct Hearsay ("they said that")**: そうだ is used when the speaker is directly reporting what they heard or read from a source. *You are essentially quoting the information*.

- For example, if you want to **directly quote** information about a school's winter festival that you heard directly from your principal, would can say: 校[こう]長[ちょう]先生によると、学校の冬[ふゆ]祭[まつ]りは六月二十七日にあるそうです。
- In this case, you are directly quoting the principal's information about the winter festival, so そう is used to indicate that you are relaying this information as it was presented to you.

**らしい - Indirect Hearsay or Inference**: らしい is used when the information is *indirect*, *summarised (rather than quoted)*, *hearsay (based on what someone heard from someone else)*, or when the *speaker is making an inference* based on the information from the source.

- Let's take the following conversation as an example:
    - ::red{A: あー、この所[ところ]にすしやがありませんでしたね} → Ah, wasn't there a sushi restaurant around here?
    - ::green{B: そうですね。友[とも]達[だち]によると、新[あたら]しいかんこく料[りょう]理[り]が近[ちか]くにできたらしいですよ} → Yes. According to my friend, it seems that a new Korean restaurant has opened nearby.
    - ::red{A: そうですか。 面[おも]白[しろ]そうですね} → Is that so? It sounds interesting.
- Here, the friend is not the original source of the information about the new Korean restaurant as they evidentally heard it from someone else. ::green{B} is summarising (NOT QUOTING) what they heard from their friend, therefore, making this information indirect hearsay. Hence, らしい is used in this case.

## Let's Practice!
Take this short quiz to understand the different cases where you would use そう or らしい after によると.

/w Make sure to always end your references with そう or らしい. Without them, it sounds like what you are saying is irrefutable, which is never the case when you parrot information read from a source. \

# Using によると～そう/らしい in sentences
Here are some more examples of how to use によると with そう and らしい in sentences:

:::blockquote <strong>天[てん]気[き]予[よ]報[ほう]によると、明日[あした]は晴[は]れるそうです</strong> :::

/t Without clicking the spoiler, try to guess the meaning of the sentence above.  \

Hint 1: ||By this point, you should know that 天[てん]気[き] means "weather". However, "予報" you might not know. Try looking at the Kanji and see if you can recognise any familiar characters.||

Hint 2: ||If you did the [Expressing Intentions and Plans](grammar:intent-plans) lesson, you should be able to recognise the 予, pairing with 予定 gets you よてい, meaning "plan" or "forecast".||

Hint 3: ||So, now you know 天気 means weather and 予 means 'plan' Without even knowing the reading of 報, you can probably guess that 予報 means "forecast".||

Translation: ||The sentence means "According to the weather forecast, it is said that it will be sunny tomorrow."||

In the above sentence, we use そう because the weather forecast is a widely accepted source of information and implies a moderate level of certainty.

**Let's try another example**:

:::blockquote <strong>新[しん]聞[ぶん]によると、その映[えい]画[が]はとても面白[おもしろ]いらしいです</strong> :::

Translation: ||According to the newspaper, it seems that the movie is very interesting.||

らしい is chosen because the speaker is not directly quoting the newspaper. They are giving a summary or interpretation of what they read. Furthermore, the use of らしい indicates that the speaker is conveying their impression of the movie based on the newspaper's review, rather than stating it as an absolute fact.

/t This structure is a very good grammar point to learn as it is often forgotten about by students. \
