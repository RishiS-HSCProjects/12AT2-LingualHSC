title: "Relative Clauses"
summary: "Learn how to form and use relative clauses in Japanese to describe nouns with additional information."

---

In Japanese, relative clauses are used to provide additional information about a noun. Unlike in English, where relative clauses are often introduced by words like "who," "which," or "that," in Japanese, the relative clause comes before the noun it modifies without any additional words.

Relative clauses allow you to make more sophisticated sentences as you are providing extra details about the noun.

For example, consider the sentence:

:::blockquote I bought a book yesterday and I read that book today. :::

By your current knowledge, you might say: 昨日[きのう]、本を買[かい]って、今日、その本を読[よ]みました. However, this sentence sounds a bit too long and repetitive. Instead, you can use a relative clause to combine the two sentences!

:::blockquote Clause 1 + Verb (plain form) + Clause 2 :::

/t Looks familiar? It uses the same structure as [と言う](grammar:to-for-expression#naming-things-and-places) when you describe a noun as “called” something. You’ve already worked with similar relative forms! \

Using this structure, you can say:

- 昨日[きのう]買[か]った本[ほん]を今日[きょう]読[よ]みました → I read the book that I bought yesterday today.
    - Here, 昨日[きのう]買った本 is the relative clause modifying 本 (book).
- 彼[かれ]が書[か]いた手[て]紙[がみ]を読[よ]みました → I read the letter that he wrote.
    - Here, 彼が書いた手紙 is the relative clause modifying 手紙 (letter).
- 私[わたし]が作[つく]ったケーキを食[た]べました → I ate the cake that I made.
    - Here, 私が作[つく]ったケーキ is the relative clause modifying ケーキ (cake).
- 昨日[きのう]見[み]た映[えい]画[が]は面[おも]白[しろ]かったです → The movie that I watched yesterday was interesting.
    - Here, 昨日[きのう]見た映[えい]画[が] is the relative clause modifying 映[えい]画[が] (movie).

/w Don't worry if you get any of the above questions wrong. They were designed to be very difficult, and you usually will never find sentences like that in your HSC exams. However, if you answered all of the above, you can call yourself a master of the  relative clause! \
