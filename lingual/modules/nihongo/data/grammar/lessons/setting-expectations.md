# Setting Expectations using はず
In this lesson, we will learn how to express expectations and assumptions in Japanese using the particle はず (hazu). This particle is used to indicate that something is expected to happen or that something should be the case based on prior knowledge or reasoning.

## Formation
The structure for using はず is as follows:

---

:::blockquote Verb (plain form, any tense) + はずだ :::

- 毎[まい]日[にち]勉[べん]強[きょう]する**はずだ** → I am expected to study every day.
- 遅くならない**はずだ** → I expect not to be late.
- 彼[かれ]は来[こ]れる**はずだ** → I expect that he can come.

---

:::blockquote Adjective (plain form, any tense) + はずだ :::

- この映[えい]画[が]は面[おも]白[しろ]い**はずだった** → I expected this movie to be interesting.
- 彼[かれ]女[じょ]はやさしかった**はずだ** → I expect her to have been kind.
- 彼[かれ]は元[げん]気[き]な**はずだ** → He is expected to be healthy.

/i Note that the な from な adjective is retained before はずだ. \

:::blockquote Noun + の + はずだ :::

- 彼[かれ]は医者[いしゃ]の**はずだ** → He is expected to be a doctor.
- 今日は休[きゅう]みの**はずだ** → Today is expected to be a holiday.
- 彼[かれ]女[じょ]は学生[がくせい]の**はずだ** → She is expected to be a student.

If the noun is in the past tense, use だった before はずだ.

:::blockquote Noun + だった + はずだ :::

- 彼[かれ]は先生[せんせい]だった**はずだ** → He was expected to be a teacher.
- 昨日[きのう]は晴[は]れだった**はずだ** → Yesterday was expected to be sunny.
- 彼[かれ]女[じょ]は友達[ともだち]だった**はずだ** → She was expected to be a friend.
