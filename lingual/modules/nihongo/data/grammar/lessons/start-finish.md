title: "Saying When an Action Starts and Finishes"
summary: "Learn how to express the start and finish of actions in Japanese."

---

In Japanese, you can express when an action starts and finishes by using specific verb forms and expressions. This is useful for indicating the beginning and end of activities in both casual and formal contexts.

- To indicate the start of an action, you can use the verb stem followed by 始[はじ]める, which means "to begin" or "to start."
- To indicate the finish of an action, you can use the verb stem followed by 終[お]わる, which means "to finish" or "to end."

For both sentences, use the following structure:

:::blockquote Verb stem + 始[はじ]める/終[お]わる :::

- Example of starting an action:
  
  - 勉強[べんきょう]を始[はじ]める (to start studying)
  - 映画[えいが]を見[み]始[はじ]める (to start watching a movie)

- Example of finishing an action:

    - 宿[しゅく]題[だい]を終[お]わる (to finish homework)
    - 食[しょく]事[じ]を終[お]わる (to finish a meal)
