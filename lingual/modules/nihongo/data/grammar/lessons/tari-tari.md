title: "The ～たり ～たり Pattern"
summary: "Learn about how to use the ～たり ～たり pattern in Japanese to list actions or states."

---

This far, you would have only learned how to use verbs in their ます form to describe actions. However, this form is limited in that it can only describe one action at a time.

Imagine if someone were to ask you what you did over the weekend, and you only reply with "I went to the park and played tennis. I also read a book." While this is grammatically correct, it sounds a bit unnatural and incomplete as it has the nuance that these were the only things you did, which is obviously not the case. 

The ～たり ～たり pattern allows you to list multiple actions or states without implying that these were the only things you did. It can be directly translated to "doing things like [action] and [action]".

:::blockquote [Action] [Verb in たり form] + [Action] [Verb in たり form] + する :::

/w Note the sentence must always end with an inflection of する. \

## Forming the たり Form
To form the たり form of a verb, you first need to convert the verb into its past positive plain form (also known as the [た-form](grammar:plain-form)). Once you have the た-form, simply replace the た ending with たり.

For example:

- 飲みます → 飲ん**だ** → 飲ん**たり** (to do things like drink)
- 食べます → 食べ**た** → 食べ**たり** (to do things like eat)
- 行きます → 行っ**た** → 行っ**たり** (to do things like went)
