# ながら (While)
The structure Verb (stem form) + ながら is used to indicate that two actions are happening simultaneously. The action described by the verb in the ながら form is usually a secondary action that occurs while the main action is taking place.

:::blockquote Verb (stem form) + ながら :::

The primary action (the main thing you are doing) comes after ～ながら in the sentence.

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞[き]きながら勉[べん]強[きょう]します → I study while listening to music.
    - Here, the main action is studying, and listening to music is the secondary action.
- テレビを見[み]ながら食[た]べます → I eat while watching TV.
    - Here, the main action is eating, and watching TV is the secondary action.
- 散歩[さんぽ]しながら話[はな]します → I talk while taking a walk.
    - Here, the main action is talking, and taking a walk is the secondary action.

/w Don't let the な in ながら confuse you! ながら requires the verb stem, NOT the ない form of the verb! \

## 間 vs ながら
Both 間 and ながら can be used to express simultaneous actions, but they have different nuances and structures.

- 間 is used to indicate that one action occurs during the duration of another action. It often implies that the two actions are happening over a period of time.
    - Example: 映画を見ている間にポップコーンを食べます → I eat popcorn while watching a movie.
- ながら is used to indicate that two actions are happening at the same time, with one action being the main focus and the other being secondary.
    - Example: 音楽を聞きながら勉強します → I study while listening to music.
