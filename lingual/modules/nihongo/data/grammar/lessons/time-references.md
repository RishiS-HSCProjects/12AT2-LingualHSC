In Japanese, you can reference time to indicate when an action takes place in relation to other events.

# 時に (When)

This structure is used to indicate the specific time when an action occurs. The word 時[とき] means "time" or "when," and it is used after the plain form of verbs, adjectives, or nouns.

:::blockquote Verb (plain form) + 時に :::

- 映[えい]画[が]を見る時にポップコーンを食[た]べます → I eat popcorn when I watch a movie.
- 学校[がっこう]に行く時に友達[ともだち]に会[あ]います → I meet my friends when I go to school.
    - Notice how the verb 行く is in its positive plain form before 時に.
    - Can you see how this is different from using *た時に*?
- 子[こ]供[ども]の時、バスケットボールを始[はじ]めました。 → When I was a child, I started playing basketball.

:::blockquote Adjective (any tense) + 時に :::

- 暑[あつ]い時[とき]につめたい飲[の]み物[もの]を飲[の]みます → I drink cold beverages when it is hot.
- いそがしい時に音[おん]楽[がく]を聞きます → I listen to music when I am busy.

:::blockquote Noun + の + 時に :::
- 学生[がくせい]の時に日本[にほん]に行[い]きました → I went to Japan when I was a student.
- 休[やす]みの時に旅行[りょこう]します → I travel during the holidays.

# 前 (Before)
The word 前[まえ] means "before" and is used to indicate that one action occurs before another action. (Woah, what??)

:::blockquote Verb (plain form) + 前に :::

- 食[た]べる前に手[て]を洗[あら]います → I wash my hands before eating.
- 学校[がっこう]に行[い]く前に朝[あさ]ご飯[はん]を食[た]べます → I eat breakfast before going to school.
- 映[えい]画[が]を見[み]る前にチケットを買[か]います → I buy tickets before watching a movie.

:::blockquote Noun + の + 前に :::

- 会議[かいぎ]の前に準備[じゅんび]をします → I prepare before the meeting.
- 出発[しゅっぱつ]の前に荷物[にもつ]を確認[かくにん]します → I check my luggage before departure.
- 試験[しけん]の前に勉強[べんきょう]します → I study before the exam.

# 間 (During)
The word 間[あいだ] means "during" or "while" and is used to indicate that one action occurs while another action is happening.

/w The pronounciation of 間 is あいだ, NOT かん! \

:::blockquote Verb (て-form) + いる + 間 :::

- 映[えい]画[が]を見[み]ている間[あいだ]にポップコーンを食[た]べます → I eat popcorn while watching a movie.
- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞[き]いている間[あいだ]に勉[べん]強[きょう]します → I study while listening to music.

:::blockquote Place + に + いる　+ 間 :::
- 学校にいる間[あいだ]に友[とも]達[だち]と話[はな]します → I talk with my friends while at school.
- 日本にいる間[あいだ]にたくさん写[しゃ]真[しん]を撮[と]りました → I took a lot of photos while in Japan.

:::blockquote Noun + の + 間 :::
- 会議[かいぎ]の間[あいだ]にメモを取[と]ります → I take notes during the meeting.
- 昼休[ひるやす]みの間[あいだ]に友達[ともだち]と話[はな]します → I talk with my friends during lunch break.

# ながら (While)
The structure Verb (stem form) + ながら is used to indicate that two actions are happening simultaneously. The action described by the verb in the ながら form is usually a secondary action that occurs while the main action is taking place.

:::blockquote Verb (stem form) + ながら :::

The primary action (the main thing you are doing) comes after ～ながら in the sentence.

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞[き]きながら勉[べん]強[きょう]します → I study while listening to music.
    - Here, the main action is studying, and listening to music is the secondary action.
- テレビを見[み]ながら食[た]べます → I eat while watching TV.
    - Here, the main action is eating, and watching TV is the secondary action.
- 散歩[さんぽ]しながら話[はな]します → I talk while taking a walk.
    - Here, the main action is talking, and taking a walk is the secondary action.

/w Don't let the な in ながら confuse you! ながら requires the verb stem, NOT the ない form of the verb! \

## 間 vs ながら
Both 間 and ながら can be used to express simultaneous actions, but they have different nuances and structures.

- 間 is used to indicate that one action occurs during the duration of another action. It often implies that the two actions are happening over a period of time.
    - Example: 映画を見ている間にポップコーンを食べます → I eat popcorn while watching a movie.
- ながら is used to indicate that two actions are happening at the same time, with one action being the main focus and the other being secondary.
    - Example: 音楽を聞きながら勉強します → I study while listening to music.
