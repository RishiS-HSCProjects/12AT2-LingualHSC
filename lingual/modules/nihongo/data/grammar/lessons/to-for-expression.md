summary: "Learn how to use the particle と to express speech, thoughts, and other actions."

In Japanese, the particle と is commonly used to indicate direct or indirect speech, thoughts, and other expressions. When combined with verbs like 言[い]う (to say), 思[おも]う (to think), and others, it helps convey what someone said or thought.

This lesson will explore multiple uses of the particle と to express various actions in Japanese.

# Using と for Expressions

:::blockquote Verb (any tense) + と :::
:::blockquote い-adjective + (かった) + と :::
:::blockquote Noun / な-adjective (omit な) + **だ** (だった) + と :::

/w It's very common for learners to forget the だ when using な-adjectives and nouns. Expect to see many questions about this! \

# The と言う Structure

## Quoting Speech

When you want to quote what someone said, you can use the structure:

:::blockquote [Subject] + は + [Quoted Speech] + と + 言う (any tense) :::

The quoted speech can be in any tense (as they were originally said) and optionally be enclosed in quotation marks.

For example:

- 彼[かれ]は「明日[あした]行[い]く」と言[い]った → He said, "I will go tomorrow." (Implies that *he* will be the one going tomorrow, not the speaker.)
- 彼[かの]女[じょ]はいそがしいと言[い]った → She said she is busy.
- 母はいつも「部[へ]屋[や]がきたない」と言います → My mum always says, "Your room is dirty."
- 先[せん]生[せい]は明日[あした]休[やす]みだと言[い]いました → The teacher said that tomorrow is a holiday.

## Naming Things and Places

To express something is called a certain name, you can use the structure:

:::blockquote Name + と言[い]う + Noun :::

/t There is no compulsion to use the 言[い] Kanji in this form. However, some HSC markers may be rigid about its inclusion, so it is best to learn to include it. \

/w Note that the order of the words for this structure is the reverse from English. Take care to notice this feat in the below examples. \

- シドニーボイズと言う高[こう]校[こう] → A high school called "Sydney Boys"
- リングアルと言うアプリ → An app called "Lingual"
- 富[ふ]士[じ]山[さん]と言う山[やま] → A mountain called "Mount Fuji"

## Softening Statements
You can also use the と言う structure to soften statements or make them less direct. This is often used in polite conversation or when you want to avoid sounding too blunt.

For example:
- 彼[かれ]はあまり勉強[べんきょう]しないと言[い]う人[ひと]です → He is a person who doesn't study much. (Softens the statement about his study habits.)
-彼[かれ]は医者[いしゃ]という仕事[しごと]をしている → He works in a job called "doctor". (Softens the statement about his profession.)

## Expressing Thoughts and Feelings
To express what someone thinks or feels, you can use the structure:
:::blockquote [Subject] + は + [Thought/Feeling] + と + 思[おも]う (any tense) :::

For example:

- 明日[あした]雨[あめ]が降[ふ]ると思[おも]います → I think it will rain tomorrow.
- 彼[かれ]は神[かみ]の話[はなし]が本[ほん]当[とう]だと思[おも]っている → He believes that the stories about God are true.
- 彼[かれ]女[じょ]は彼[かれ]が好きだと思[おも]います → I think she likes him.

/i Even though は follows "her", the individual thinking the thought is actually the speaker, since "She thinks [she] likes him" can sound odd in some contexts. If you would like to understand how to write the latter, read below. \

### 思[おも]う vs 思[おも]っている
To talk about thoughts in Japanese, it’s important to distinguish between **思う** and **思っている**, because they express different kinds of thinking.

- **思う** is used for immediate thoughts or opinions that can change quickly. It’s like saying "I think" in English when you’re expressing a current opinion.
  
    Example: ジャケットを着[き]ると思[おも]います → I think I will wear a jacket. (This is your current opinion and could change.)

- **思っている** is used for ongoing beliefs or thoughts that are more stable and long-term. It’s like saying "I believe" or "I have been thinking" in English.
  
    Example: 彼[かれ]は正直[しょうじき]だと思[おも]っている → I believe he is honest. (This is a belief you hold over time.)

Other Examples:

- 今[いま]は雨[あめ]が降[ふ]ると思[おも]います → I think it will rain now.
    /i 思います expresses the speaker’s current thought \
- 彼[かれ]は神[かみ]の話[はなし]が本[ほん]当[とう]だと思[おも]っている → He believes that the stories about God are true.
    /i 思っている shows an ongoing belief held by someone else \
- 彼[かの]女[じょ]は彼[かれ]のことが好[す]きだと思[おも]います → I think she likes him.
    /i 思います expresses the speaker’s current thought \
- 彼[かの]女[じょ]は彼[かれ]のことが好[す]きだと思[おも]っている → She thinks (believes) that she likes him.
    /i 思っている is required when describing another person’s internal thoughts 

/w This rule holds true for all other verbs EXCLUDING と言う. と言っている simply means the subject is actively saying something. \

# Other Verbs Used with と
The particle と can also be used with other verbs to express various actions, such as:

- **聞[き]く (to hear/ask)**: 彼[かれ]は「元気[げんき]ですか」と聞[き]いた → He asked, "How are you?"
- **さけぶ (to shout)**: 彼[かれ]は「だめ！」とさけんだ → He shouted, "No!"
- **約束[やくそく]する (to promise)**: 彼[かれ]は「明日[あした]来[く]る」と約束[やくそく]した → He promised to come tomorrow.
- **知[し]る (to know)**: 彼[かれ]は真[しん]実[じつ]だと知[し]っている → He knows the truth.

All of these verbs follow the same patterns as described above. As always, practice using these structures to become more comfortable with them in conversation and writing!
