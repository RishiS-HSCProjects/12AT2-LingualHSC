Let's say your friend invites you to a party, but you can't go because you have to study. You could say, *ごめん、行けない。勉[べん]強[きょう]しなければならない。* but this can sometimes sound a bit blunt, like you are saying. "I can't go because I have to study."

By using ～ん (の) です, you can soften your explanation and make it sound more natural and polite. You could say: *ごめん、行けない**ん**です。勉強しなければならない**ん**です。* This translates to "I'm sorry, I can't go because I have to study," but with a softer and more explanatory tone.
