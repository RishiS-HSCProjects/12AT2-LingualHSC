summary: Learn how to use なる to express change or transformation in Japanese sentences.

なる means "to become" or "to turn into" and is used to indicate a change of state or condition. It is commonly used in various contexts to describe transformations, changes in feelings, or changes in circumstances. This is a very important structure to be familiar with since you will frequently use and encounter it in both spoken and written Japanese.

:::warning To indicate a change of a verb, refer to the lesson on [Using よう](grammar:using-you#indicating-change-of-state) :::

- 毎[まい]日[にち]運[うん]動[どう]し始[はじ]めましたから、元気になりました → Because I started exercising every day, I became healthy.
