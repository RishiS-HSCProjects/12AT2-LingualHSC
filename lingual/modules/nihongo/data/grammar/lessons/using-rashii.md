**らしい** is used to indicate that something is heard from someone else, or that something seems to be a certain way based on indirect information. It can be translated as "it seems that" or "I heard that" in English.

:::blockquote Information + らしい :::

- 天[てん]気[き]がいい**らしい**です → It seems that the weather is good.
- 彼[かれ]は忙[いそが]しい**らしい**ですよ → I heard that he is busy.
- その映画[えいが]は面白[おもしろ]い**らしい**です → I heard that the movie is interesting.
- 彼[かの]女[じょ]は日本語が上[じょう]手[ず]**らしい**です → It seems that she is good at Japanese.

らしい holds a nuance of uncertainty or hearsay, indicating that the information is not directly confirmed by the speaker but is based on what they have heard or observed. It is often used when the speaker wants to convey information that they are not entirely sure about or when they want to express an impression based on indirect evidence.

# Using らしい for similarities (like)

らしい can also be used to express that something resembles or is similar to something else. In this case, it can be translated as "like" or "similar to" in English. This works similarly to the みたい construction.

:::blockquote Noun + らしい + Noun :::

- 彼[かれ]は先生[せんせい]**らしい**人[ひと]です → He is a person like a teacher.
- その料[りょう]理[り]はおいしい**らしい**味[あじ]がします → That dish seems to have a delicious taste.
- 彼[かの]女[じょ]は猫[ねこ]**らしい**動[うご]き[き]をします → She moves like a cat.
