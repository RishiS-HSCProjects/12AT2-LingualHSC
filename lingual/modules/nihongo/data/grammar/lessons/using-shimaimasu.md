summary: "Learn how to use the 〜しまいます form in Japanese to express completion or regret."

---

The 〜しまいます form in Japanese is used to express the completion of an action or to convey a sense of regret about an action that has been completed. It can be used in both formal and informal contexts.

:::blockquote Verb (te-form) + しまいます :::

- 宿題[しゅくだい]を忘[わす]れてしまいました。→ I forgot my homework (and I regret it).
- ケーキを全部[ぜんぶ]食[た]べてしまった。→ I ate all the cake (and I regret it).
- 財布[さいふ]をなくしてしまいました。→ I lost my wallet (and I regret it).
- 本[ほん]を読[よ]んでしまいます。→ I will finish reading the book.

/w It is not a necessity to always imply regret with 〜しまいます. Sometimes it simply indicates that an action has been completed. However, the HSC may often expect the nuance of regret to be understood when using this form. \

The last example feels really neutral, simply indicating the completion of the action without regret. However, you could imply that the speaker feels a bit sad about finishing the book, since it was a book they enjoyed. Or maybe, they regret reading it because it had a very sad ending!

Such meanings often depend on context, tone of voice, and additional information provided in the conversation.
