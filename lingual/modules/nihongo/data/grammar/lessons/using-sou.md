そう is added to the end of adjectives and verbs to express that something "looks" or "seems" a certain way.

There are two uses of そう:

1. To express that something appears to be a certain way based on visual or sensory information (i.e., "looks like" or "seems like").
2. To express hearsay or information obtained from others (i.e., "I heard that...").

In this lesson, we will go through both uses of そう with examples.

# 1. Expressing Appearance

:::blockquote い-adjective (remove い) + そう :::

- このケーキは美[お]味[い]し**そう**です → This cake looks delicious.
- あの映[えい]画[が]は面[おも]白[しろ]**そう**ですね → That movie looks interesting, doesn't it?

:::blockquote な-adjective + そう :::
- 彼[かれ]は親[しん]切[せつ]**そう**な人[ひと]です → He seems like a kind person.
- 今日[きょう]の天気[てんき]は良[よ]さ**そう**です → Today's weather looks good.

:::blockquote Verb stem + そう :::
- 雨[あめ]が降[ふ]り**そう**です → It looks like it's going to rain.
- 彼[かれ]は今[いま]にも来[き]**そう**です → He looks like he's about to come any moment now.

# 2. Expressing Hearsay

:::blockquote い-adjective (keep い) + そう :::

- このレストランは高[たか]い**そう**です → I heard that this restaurant is expensive.
- あの話[はなし]は面[おも]白[しろ]い**そう**です → I heard that the story is interesting.

:::blockquote な-adjective + **だ** + **そう** :::

- シドニーのバスは便[べん]利[り]**だそう**です → I heard that Sydney's buses are convenient.
- 庭[にわ]は静[しず]かできれい**だそう**です → I heard that the garden is quiet and beautiful.

/w Students often forget to include the だ before そう when using な-adjectives in hearsay. Remember to include it! \

:::blockquote Verb (dictionary form) + そう :::

- 先[せん]生[せい]は毎[まい]日[にち]ジョギングをする**そう**です → I heard that he jogs every day.
- みやざきはやおさんは私の高校に来[く]る**そう**です。 → I heard that Hayao Miyazaki is coming to my high school.
