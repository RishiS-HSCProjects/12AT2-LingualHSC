# Expressing "So that..." or "In order to..."

You can use the 〜ように form to express the purpose of an action, similar to "so that..." or "in order to..." in English.

You will need to know two variations of this structure.

:::blockquote (Undesired) Verb (ない form) + ように + (Action):::

This structure is used when you want to express doing something in order to avoid or prevent an undesired outcome.

- 忘[わす]れないように、メモを取[と]ります → I take notes so that I don't forget.
    - In this sentence, the undesired outcome is forgetting something.
    - To avoid forgetting, the action of taking notes is performed.
- おなかはいたくならないように、早[はや]く食[た]ないでください → Please don't eat quickly so that you don't get a stomachache.
    - Here, the undesired outcome is getting a stomachache.
    - To prevent this, the action of not eating quickly is advised.

:::blockquote Verb (plain form, present tense) + ように :::

This structure is used when you want to express doing something in order to achieve a desired outcome. The use of potential form makes the translation like "in order for the ability to do X, Y is done".

- 弟[おとうと]が読[よ]めるように、ひらがなに書[か]きました → In order for my younger brother to be able to read it, I wrote it in hiragana.
    - In this sentence, the desired outcome is the younger brother being able to read.
    - To achieve this, the action of writing in hiragana is performed.

# Indicating Change of State

The 〜ように form can also be used to indicate a change of state or condition, similar to how なる is used. This usage is often seen in more formal contexts.

:::blockquote Verb (Potential form) + ようになる :::

/i This structure indicates that someone has reached the ability or possibility to do something, often implying a change from not being able to do it before. \

- 日本語[にほんご]が話[はな]せるようになりました → I have become able to speak Japanese.
- 車[くるま]を運転[うんてん]できるようになりました → I have become able to drive a car.
- 毎日[まいにち]走[はし]るようになりました → I have started running every day.

:::blockquote Verb (dictionary form, present positive / negative) + ようにする :::

/i This structure is used to express the change in habit or effort. \

- 毎[まい]日[にち]やさいを食[た]べるようになります → I will make it a habit to eat vegetables every day.
- 毎[まい]日[にち]早[はや]く寝[ね]るようになりています → I am getting into the habit of going to bed early every day.
