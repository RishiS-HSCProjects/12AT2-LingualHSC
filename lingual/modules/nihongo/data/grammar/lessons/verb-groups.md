# The Three Verb Groups in Japanese
Japanese verbs are categorized into three main groups based on their conjugation patterns.

## Group 1: Godan Verbs
Also known as consonant-stem verbs, Godan verbs are the most common type of verbs in Japanese.

五[ご]段[だん] literally translates to "five steps", referring to the five different vowel endings that these verbs can take when conjugated. You will learn more about these conjugation patterns in later lessons.

They conjugate by changing the final syllable of the verb stem according to a specific pattern. 

### Examples of Godan Verbs
- 書[か]く - to write
- 話[は]す - to speak
- 飲[の]む - to drink
- 歩[あるき]る - to walk
- 泳[およ]ぐ - to swim
### Conjugation Cheatsheet

Here is a quick reference for how the final syllable of Godan verbs changes during conjugation.

| Vowel Sound | Form | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|------|---------|---------|
| あ | ない Form | 書かない | do not write |
| い | ます Form | 書きます | to write |
| う | Dictionary Form | 書く | to write |
| え | Potential Form | 書ける | can write |
| お | Volitional Form | 書こう | let's write |

## Group 2: Ichidan Verbs
Also known as vowel-stem verbs, Ichidan verbs are easier to conjugate than Godan verbs because they follow a more straightforward pattern. You can identify Group 2 verbs as they (usually) have a stem that ends with an え sound or a singular character before the final る.

一[いち]段[だん] translates to "one step", indicating that these verbs have a single vowel ending that changes during conjugation. (The Japanese are very helpful with these naming conventions!)

They conjugate by removing the final る and adding the appropriate ending.

### Examples of Ichidan Verbs
- 食[た]べる - to eat
- 見[み]る - to see
- 起[お]きる - to wake up
- 寝[ね]る - to sleep
- 教[お]しる - to teach
## Group 3: Irregular Verbs
There are only two main irregular verbs in Japanese: する (suru - to do) and 来[く]る (kuru - to come). These verbs do not follow the standard conjugation patterns of Godan or Ichidan verbs and are different on a case-by-case basis.

/i 行[い]く sometimes is counted as an irregular verb as it sometimes takes the rules of the other Godan verbs and other time decides to do it's own thing. E.g. 行く in て-form becomes 行って, not 行いて. \

# Summary
Understanding the three verb groups in Japanese is crucial for mastering verb conjugation. Each group has its own set of rules and patterns that you will need to learn to use verbs correctly in various contexts.
By familiarizing yourself with Godan, Ichidan, and Irregular verbs, you'll be well on your way to becoming proficient in Japanese verb usage!
