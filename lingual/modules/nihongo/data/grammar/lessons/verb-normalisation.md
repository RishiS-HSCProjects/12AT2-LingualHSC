# What is Verb Normalisation?
Verb normalisation in Japanese refers to the process of converting verbs into nouns, similar to how adding '-tion', '-ment', and '-ness' does in English. 

This is done by using the plain form (dictionary form) of the verb and adding either **の** or **こと** after it. Both **の** and **こと** can be used interchangeably to nominalise verbs, but they have slightly different nuances and usages.

The particle **の** is often used to nominalise verbs when the action is more immediate, personal, or when referring to specific instances of an action. It is commonly used in casual speech.

The particle **こと**, on the other hand, is used for more general or abstract actions, often in formal contexts. It can refer to habitual actions or general concepts.

## は or が
When using normalised verbs in sentences, you will often need to mark them with the particles **は** or **が**, depending on the context.

You can learn more about the general differences between は and が in the [は vs が lesson](grammar:ha-vs-ga). Here, we will focus on their usage with normalised verbs.

- Use **は** when the normalised verb is the topic of the sentence.
- Use **が** when the normalised verb is the subject of the sentence.

For example:

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の**::blue{は}楽[たの]しいです。→ Listening to music is fun.
/i Here, 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の** is the topic of the sentence, so we use は. \
- 走[はし]る**こと**::blue{が}健康[けんこう]に良[よ]いです。→ Running is good for health.
/i Here, 走[はし]る**こと** is the subject of the sentence, so we use が. \

Let's do some quick revision on how to form the plain present form of verbs. Remember, all you will need to do to normalise verbs is add **の** or **こと** after the plain present form.

# Saying Likes and Dislikes
One common use of verb normalisation is to express likes and dislikes. In Japanese, you can say you like or dislike doing something by using the structure:
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{好[す]き/嫌[きら]い} :::

For example:

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の**::blue{が}::green{好き}です。→ I like listening to music.
- 走[はし]る**こと**::blue{が}::green{嫌[きら]い}です。→ I dislike running.

Your turn! Try forming sentences expressing likes or dislikes using the verbs below:

# Talking about Strengths and Weaknesses
You can also use verb normalisation to talk about being good or bad at doing something. The structure is similar to expressing likes and dislikes:
## Strengths
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{上[じょう]手[ず] / とくい} :::

/i 上[じょう]手[ず] is used when expressing someone else's skill, while とくい is used for oneself. Do not use 上[じょう]手[ず] to refer to your own strengths. \

For example:

- ピアノをひく**こと**::blue{が}::green{上[じょう]手[ず]}です。→ They are good at playing the piano.
- 日本語を話す**の**::blue{が}::green{上[じょう]手[ず]}ですね。→ You are good at speaking Japanese.

## Weaknesses
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{下手[へた] / にがて} :::

/i 下手[へた] is used when expressing someone else's lack of skill, while にがて is used for oneself. Do not use 下手[へた] to refer to your own weaknesses. \

For example:

- 絵[え]を描[か]く**の**::blue{が}::green{下手[へた]}です。→ They are bad at drawing.
- スポーツをする**こと**::blue{が}::green{にがて}です。→ I am bad at playing sports.

Now it's your turn! Try forming sentences about strengths and weaknesses using the verbs below:

# Talking about Past Experiences

/t This structure is very common in speaking exams, as they are usually interviews about you. \

You can also use verb normalisation to talk about past experiences. The structure is as follows:
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Past Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{あります/ありません} :::

For example:

- 日本に行った**こと**::blue{が}::green{あります}。→ I have been to Japan.
- 富[ふ]士[じ]山[さん]を登[のぼ]った**の**::blue{が}::green{ありません}。→ I have never climbed Mount Fuji.

You can also ask others about their past experiences by adding か at the end of the sentence.

- ボートに乗った**こと**::blue{が}::green{ありますか}。→ Have you ever ridden a boat?
- すしを食べた**の**::blue{が}::green{ありませんか}。→ Have you never eaten sushi?

# Using ない～ことはない for "Not Impossible"

/w This is not prescribed in the HSC syllabus, but it is a useful structure to know! \

You can use the structure **ない～ことはない** to express that something is **not impossible** or that there is a possibility of something happening, even if it is unlikely.

Note: Unlike other cases of verb normalisation, you can not use **の** with this structure; only **こと** is used.

/t ことはない is the same as ことはありません as ない is the plain form of ありません. \

:::blockquote Verb (ない form) + ことはない :::

- スキーはできないことはないけど、あまり上[じょう]手[ず]じゃない。→ It's not that I can't ski, but I'm not very good at it.
- 車[くるま]は運[うん]転[てん]できないことはないんですが、ほとんどしません → It's not that I can't drive, but I hardly ever do.

:::blockquote い-adjective (ない form) + ことはない :::

- 高くないことはないけど、買わないといけないよ → It's not that it's not expensive, but I have to buy it.
- 冬の時はさむくないことはないけど、ジャケットはいらないよ → It's not that it's not cold in winter, but you don't need a jacket.

:::blockquote な-adjective (remove な) + ではない・じゃない + ことはない :::

- 有[ゆう]名[めい]ではないことはありませんが、オーストラリア人はあの人を知りません → It's not that he isn't famous, but Australians don't know him.
- 便利[べんり]じゃないことはないけど、あまり使いません → It's not that it's not convenient, but I don't use it much.

:::blockquote Noun + ではない・じゃない + ことはない :::

- あのいしゃはいいいしゃしゃないことはないけど、はいしゃじゃないよ → It's not that that doctor isn't a good doctor, but he's not a dentist.
- 高[たか]いホテルではないことはありませんが、あまり高くないです → It's not that the hotel isn't expensive, but it's not very expensive.
