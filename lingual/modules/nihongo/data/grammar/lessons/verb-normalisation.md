# What is Verb Normalisation?
Verb normalisation in Japanese refers to the process of converting verbs into nouns, similar to how adding '-tion', '-ment', and '-ness' does in English. 

This is done by using the plain form (dictionary form) of the verb and adding either **の** or **こと** after it. Both **の** and **こと** can be used interchangeably to nominalise verbs, but they have slightly different nuances and usages.

The particle **の** is often used to nominalise verbs when the action is more immediate, personal, or when referring to specific instances of an action. It is commonly used in casual speech.

The particle **こと**, on the other hand, is used for more general or abstract actions, often in formal contexts. It can refer to habitual actions or general concepts.

## は or が
When using normalised verbs in sentences, you will often need to mark them with the particles **は** or **が**, depending on the context.

You can learn more about the general differences between は and が in the [は vs が lesson](grammar:ha-vs-ga). Here, we will focus on their usage with normalised verbs.

- Use **は** when the normalised verb is the topic of the sentence.
- Use **が** when the normalised verb is the subject of the sentence.

For example:

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の**::blue{は}楽[たの]しいです。→ Listening to music is fun.
/i Here, 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の** is the topic of the sentence, so we use は. \
- 走[はし]る**こと**::blue{が}健康[けんこう]に良[よ]いです。→ Running is good for health.
/i Here, 走[はし]る**こと** is the subject of the sentence, so we use が. \

Let's do some quick revision on how to form the plain present form of verbs. Remember, all you will need to do to normalise verbs is add **の** or **こと** after the plain present form.

# Saying Likes and Dislikes
One common use of verb normalisation is to express likes and dislikes. In Japanese, you can say you like or dislike doing something by using the structure:
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{好[す]き/嫌[きら]い} :::

For example:

- 音[おん]楽[がく]を聞く**の**::blue{が}::green{好き}です。→ I like listening to music.
- 走[はし]る**こと**::blue{が}::green{嫌[きら]い}です。→ I dislike running.

# Talking about Strengths and Weaknesses
You can also use verb normalisation to talk about being good or bad at doing something. The structure is similar to expressing likes and dislikes:
## Strengths
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{上[じょう]手[ず] / とくい} :::

/i 上[じょう]手[ず] is used when expressing someone else's skill, while とくい is used for oneself. Do not use 上[じょう]手[ず] to refer to your own strengths. \

For example:

- ピアノをひく**こと**::blue{が}::green{上[じょう]手[ず]}です。→ They are good at playing the piano.
- 日本語を話す**の**::blue{が}::green{上[じょう]手[ず]}ですね。→ You are good at speaking Japanese.

## Weaknesses
:::blockquote [Verb in Plain Present Form] + の/こと + ::blue{が} + ::green{下手[へた] / にがて} :::

/i 下手[へた] is used when expressing someone else's lack of skill, while にがて is used for oneself. Do not use 下手[へた] to refer to your own weaknesses. \

For example:

- 絵[え]を描[か]く**の**::blue{が}::green{下手[へた]}です。→ They are bad at drawing.
- スポーツをする**こと**::blue{が}::green{にがて}です。→ I am bad at playing sports.
