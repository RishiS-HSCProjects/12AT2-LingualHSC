Let's say it was your mouth, and when you look up to see who did it, there stands <reading>Chew</reading>bacca. He's even doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his bowcaster. It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.",
