It's delicious, of course... but then he gets it caught on his lip ring, and tears half his lip off. He screams: \"<reading>Nannnnn eeeeeeeeeehhh</reading>!!\" (なに) in anger at the naan and curry.",
    "reading_hint": "Make this one vivid and scary. He's eating the naan (that's your なん), and then he screams at the naan but gets overwhelmed with pain (that's the なに). Smell the naan (you're there) and see the blood gushing out of his/her lip. It's terrifying. How did the naan even catch on his lip ring anyways?",
