When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number <kanji>six</kanji> is the devil's number.",

Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.",
