Something that's in front of you is before you, after all.",

Try to run. Try to hide. Spin around. Do whatever you need to do. No matter what, these objects are always in front.",

You finally seek the help of a <reading>Zen</reading> (ぜん) master, who tells you that meditation will save you from this curse. You try it out, and sure enough, the objects are gone! It worked!",
