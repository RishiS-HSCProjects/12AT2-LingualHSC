This man with a gun is headed your direction and he doesn’t even know what you and your tribe are gonna do to him. If he gets any closer, you’re likely to shoot that arrow right at him.",

    "reading_hint": "You remember what a bosozoku is, right? We wrote about them on Tofugu a while ago. They’re bike gang members and the “zoku” in bosozoku means tribe. Remember that article when you see this kanji.",
