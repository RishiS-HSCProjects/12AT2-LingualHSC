    "meaning_hint": "Go through in your mind the system your farm / village uses for deciding who has to sickle on any given day. It rotates, and it's a turn-based system. So, do you all stand in a line? Is there a calendar? Come up with something interesting, focusing on your turn in the process you come up with. \n\n It will be helpful to remember both the \"number in a series\" and \"turn\" meanings for the vocab coming up in the future.",
    "reading_mnemonic": "This <kanji>turn</kanji>-based rice sickle system is a contest as well! But, you are disappointed to find out that you have been <reading>ban</reading>ned (ばん) from the game because of the performance enhancing steroids you've been taking.",
    "reading_hint": "Try to feel disappointed by this. Strange thing to feel disappointed by, but you were a great sickler. You were going to win the great prize, too (come up with something huge!), but now you're banned for the season.",
