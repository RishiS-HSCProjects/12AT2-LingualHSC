# Welcome to Lingual HSC

This is the tutorial module of Lingual HSC where you can understand how we do things around here!

Lingual HSC is a language learning web application curated for the New South Wales HSC curriculum. It provides users with lessons, quizzes, and interactive content to help them learn new languages effectively. The tutorial module serves as an introduction to the features and functionalities of the application, guiding users through the various components and how to navigate them.

# Why Lingual HSC?

If you read the landing page, you would have seen that Lingual HSC is designed to be a language learning application that focuses specifically on the New South Wales cirriculum for mastering the skills you will need for the HSC. It provides a comprehensive set of resources and tools to help students prepare for their language exams, including lessons, quizzes, and interactive content.

## What we aren't

:::subject By no means is Lingual HSC built to provide a <em>fun</em> language learning experience. :::

There exists no XP.

No ::green{**gamification**}.

No ::red{**competitive**} leaderboards.

No ::blue{**social**} features.

No ::purple{**cute**} mascots. (though that's mostly because I am hopeless at graphic design! If you wanna contribute some cute mascots, please do!)

We aren't here to get you hooked on our app. We don't believe in the idea of "addictive" learning.

The ones who actually want to learn the language will instinctively log on by their own choice, without a murderous bird nagging them to do so.

## Who we are!

Simply put, Lingual HSC is a utility book meant for you to use as a reference when you need it.

:::blockquote 1. Forgot how to use a specific sentence structure? :::
Refer to the **grammar reference sheet** for a quick refresher on how to use it correctly!

:::blockquote 2. Exam coming up? :::
You could be asked to write a variety of sentences in your exams. Use **Lingual Quizzes** to test yourself on specific grammar points, vocabulary, or language-specific knowledge to make sure you have them down pat!

:::blockquote 3. Doing a writing task? :::
Quickly open up the **grammar reference sheet** to check the grammar point you might want to use!

/t Knowing and correctly using a variety of grammatical structures is key to success in writing tasks! \

:::blockquote 4. Forgetting vocab? :::
Trust me, it happens to the best of us. Use the **vocabulary reference sheet** to test yourself on vocabulary prescribed by NESA, and make sure you have them memorised for your exams! You don't want to be scurrying around your dictionary during your exams, do you!

# Our Story

They say you can't just learn anything from school, and that's true. While school provides you with a solid foundation of knowledge, it means nothing if you don't go out of your way and practise it on your own. I mean, think about it, you can't just read a book on how to ride a bike and expect to be able to do it, right? You have to actually get on the bike and practise riding it.

And that is what has worked for HSC students since the dawn of time (well, more like 1967, but you get the point). You need to go home and do a couple of past papers, write a variety of essays, and write rewrite revision notes to make sure you have understood the content and can apply it in different contexts.

The problem with this way of thinking is, however, there are not many resources out there that are designed to help you practise using content from your studied language by yourself. Sure, there are past HSC papers, but they are (obviously) made to test Year 12 graduates, making it almost impossible for Year 11s to use them for practice. You can use textbooks, but they are not designed to be used for practice, and they don't provide you with any feedback on your performance (plus, getting copies of extra textbooks is a very expensive affair).

Because of this, many students turn to online resources to help them practise. However, these resources are notorious for being:

- Not designed for the HSC curriculum, making it difficult for students to find relevant content to practise with.
- Designed for progression over the course of a few years. Last I checked, we only have two.
- Locked behind paywalls, making it inaccessible for many students.
- Teaching overtly specific content, making it difficult for students to apply the knowledge they have learned in different contexts.

And I could go on and on.
